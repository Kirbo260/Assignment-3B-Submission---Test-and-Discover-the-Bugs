Description
To give everyone an opportunity to practice writing JUnit 5 test cases and to discover the bugs, you will do this assignment (Assignment 3B) individually. Here is what you need to do:
1.	Clone your assigned program, set it up, and run it.
2.	Write JUnit 5 tests for the code. Don’t forget to comment your test classes. Each class should have the author information and other javadoc and regular comments.
3.	Discover the bugs through the tests!
4.	Take screenshots of the failed tests. 
5.	Fix the bugs and run the tests again.
6.	Take screenshots of the passed tests.
7.	Take screenshots of the coverage your tests have achieved.
8.	Upload your code to a new github repository. 
9.	Write down the bugs you discovered and your experience.
